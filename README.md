## Detailed Solutions

### Question 1: Attempt any two questions of the following [2 × 5 = 10]

#### a) What is Android? Explain Dalvik Virtual Machine.

**Answer:**

**What is Android?**  
Android is an open-source operating system developed by Google, primarily designed for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables. It is based on the Linux kernel and allows developers to create apps using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK). Android is highly customizable, supports a wide range of hardware, and powers devices from various manufacturers. It also supports wearables, TVs, cars, and other smart devices through specialized versions like Wear OS and Android Auto.

**Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM):**  
The Dalvik Virtual Machine is a process virtual machine used in Android to run applications written in Java. It is optimized for low-memory environments and executes files in the `.dex` (Dalvik Executable) format, which is generated from Java bytecode. Key features of DVM include:
- **Register-Based Architecture:** Unlike the stack-based Java Virtual Machine (JVM), DVM uses a register-based architecture, which reduces instruction count and improves performance on resource-constrained devices.
- **Optimized for Mobile Devices:** DVM is designed to run multiple instances efficiently, allowing each Android app to run in its own process with its own DVM instance.
- **Bytecode Conversion:** Android’s compiler converts Java bytecode into `.dex` format, which is more compact and suitable for mobile devices.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:** DVM uses JIT compilation to improve runtime performance by compiling bytecode into native machine code during execution.
- **Replaced by ART:** Starting with Android 4.4 (KitKat), the Android Runtime (ART) began replacing DVM, and by Android 5.0 (Lollipop), ART became the default runtime. ART uses Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation for better performance.

In summary, DVM was critical to early Android versions, enabling efficient app execution on resource-limited devices.

#### b) Explain basic building blocks of Android.

**Answer:**

The basic building blocks of an Android application are the core components that define its structure and functionality. These components are defined in the AndroidManifest.xml file and interact with each other to create a cohesive app. The four primary building blocks are:

1. **Activities:**
   - An activity represents a single screen with a user interface (UI), such as a login screen or a settings page.
   - It is implemented as a subclass of the `Activity` class.
   - Activities handle user interactions and are managed by the Android system in a stack (back stack) for navigation.
   - Example: Displaying a list of contacts is an activity.

2. **Services:**
   - A service is a component that performs long-running operations in the background without a UI.
   - It is used for tasks like playing music, downloading files, or handling network operations.
   - Services can be started (run indefinitely) or bound (interact with other components).
   - Example: A music player service continues playing audio even when the user switches apps.

3. **Broadcast Receivers:**
   - Broadcast receivers enable apps to respond to system-wide or app-specific broadcast announcements, such as low battery warnings or incoming messages.
   - They do not have a UI but can trigger notifications or start other components.
   - Example: An app receiving a notification when a new SMS arrives.

4. **Content Providers:**
   - Content providers manage access to a structured set of data, allowing apps to share data with other apps.
   - They provide a standard interface for querying, inserting, updating, or deleting data, typically stored in databases or files.
   - Example: The Contacts app uses a content provider to share contact data with other apps.

**Additional Building Blocks:**
- **Intents:** Used to communicate between components, such as starting an activity, sending a broadcast, or launching a service.
- **AndroidManifest.xml:** A configuration file that declares the app’s components, permissions, and requirements.
- **Resources:** External files like layouts, strings, and images used to design the app’s UI and functionality.

These building blocks work together to create modular, scalable Android applications.

#### c) What is Manifest XML? Explain its purpose.

**Answer:**

**What is Manifest XML?**  
The `AndroidManifest.xml` file is a crucial configuration file located in the root directory of an Android project. It is an XML file that provides essential information about the app to the Android system, which the system needs before running the app.

**Purpose of AndroidManifest.xml:**
1. **Declare App Components:**
   - It lists all the app’s components, such as activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers.
   - For example, each activity must be declared with a `<activity>` tag to be recognized by the system.

2. **Specify Permissions:**
   - The manifest declares the permissions the app requires, such as internet access (`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`) or camera access.
   - It also defines custom permissions for the app to restrict access to its components.

3. **Define App Metadata:**
   - It specifies metadata like the app’s package name, version code, version name, and minimum API level (`<uses-sdk>`).
   - Example: `android:minSdkVersion="21"` ensures the app runs on Android 5.0 or higher.

4. **Configure App Features:**
   - It declares hardware or software features the app requires, such as GPS or a touchscreen (`<uses-feature>`).
   - This helps Google Play filter the app for compatible devices.

5. **Set Entry Points:**
   - It defines the app’s entry point, typically the main activity, using an intent filter with `ACTION_MAIN` and `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`.
   - Example:
     ```xml
     <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
         <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
             <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
         </intent-filter>
     </activity>
     ```

6. **Support Backward Compatibility:**
   - It specifies compatibility settings, such as maximum SDK versions or alternative resources for older Android versions.

7. **Enable System Integration:**
   - It allows the app to integrate with system features, such as handling specific intents (e.g., sharing content or opening links).

In summary, the `AndroidManifest.xml` acts as a blueprint for the Android system, ensuring the app’s components, permissions, and requirements are properly configured for execution and distribution.

### Question 2: Attempt any two questions of the following [2 × 5 = 10]

#### a) Explain basic UI components.

**Answer:**

Basic UI components in Android are widgets and views used to build the user interface of an app. These components are part of the `android.widget` and `android.view` packages and are used to create interactive and visually appealing layouts. Below are some key UI components:

1. **TextView:**
   - A read-only text display component used to show static text, such as labels or instructions.
   - Example: `<TextView android:text="Welcome to Android" />`

2. **EditText:**
   - An editable text field that allows users to input text, such as usernames or passwords.
   - It is a subclass of TextView with input capabilities.
   - Example: `<EditText android:hint="Enter your name" />`

3. **Button:**
   - A clickable component that triggers an action when pressed, such as submitting a form.
   - Example: `<Button android:text="Submit" android:onClick="onSubmit" />`

4. **ImageView:**
   - A component used to display images, either from resources, URLs, or files.
   - Example: `<ImageView android:src="@drawable/logo" />`

5. **CheckBox:**
   - A component that allows users to select one or more options by checking boxes.
   - Example: `<CheckBox android:text="Agree to terms" />`

6. **RadioButton:**
   - A component used within a RadioGroup to allow users to select one option from a set.
   - Example:
     ```xml
     <RadioGroup>
         <RadioButton android:text="Male" />
         <RadioButton android:text="Female" />
     </RadioGroup>
     ```

7. **Spinner:**
   - A dropdown menu that allows users to select one item from a list.
   - Example: `<Spinner android:entries="@array/countries" />`

8. **ProgressBar:**
   - A component that shows the progress of an operation, such as loading or downloading.
   - Example: `<ProgressBar android:layout_width="wrap_content" />`

These components are placed within layouts (e.g., LinearLayout, RelativeLayout) and customized using attributes like `android:layout_width`, `android:text`, or `android:id`. They are essential for creating interactive and user-friendly Android interfaces.

#### b) Explain Linear Layout, Relative Layout, and Frame Layout.

**Answer:**

Layouts in Android define the structure and arrangement of UI components in an activity. Below is an explanation of LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, and FrameLayout:

1. **Linear Layout:**
   - **Definition:** LinearLayout arranges its child views in a single direction, either horizontally or vertically, as specified by the `android:orientation` attribute.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Views are placed one after another in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical).
     - The `android:layout_weight` attribute can be used to distribute space proportionally among child views.
     - Simple and efficient for linear arrangements.
   - **Example:**
     ```xml
     <LinearLayout
         android:layout_width="match_parent"
         android:layout_height="match_parent"
         android:orientation="vertical">
         <Button android:text="Button 1" />
         <Button android:text="Button 2" />
     </LinearLayout>
     ```
   - **Use Case:** Creating forms or lists where components are aligned sequentially.

2. **Relative Layout:**
   - **Definition:** RelativeLayout allows child views to be positioned relative to each other or to the parent layout using attributes like `android:layout_toRightOf` or `android:layout_below`.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Flexible for complex UI designs, as views can be anchored to other views or the parent.
     - Reduces nesting compared to LinearLayout, improving performance.
     - Deprecated in favor of ConstraintLayout in modern Android development.
   - **Example:**
     ```xml
     <RelativeLayout
         android:layout_width="match_parent"
         android:layout_height="match_parent">
         <Button
             android:id="@+id/button1"
             android:text="Button 1" />
         <Button
             android:layout_toRightOf="@id/button1"
             android:text="Button 2" />
     </RelativeLayout>
     ```
   - **Use Case:** Designing UIs where components need to be positioned relative to each other, like a login screen.

3. **Frame Layout:**
   - **Definition:** FrameLayout is a simple layout used to stack child views on top of each other, with the most recently added view on top.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Primarily used for holding a single view or overlapping views.
     - Useful for fragments or displaying temporary content like images or overlays.
     - Views can be aligned using `android:layout_gravity`.
   - **Example:**
     ```xml
     <FrameLayout
         android:layout_width="match_parent"
         android:layout_height="match_parent">
         <ImageView android:src="@drawable/background" />
         <TextView android:text="Overlay Text" />
     </FrameLayout>
     ```
   - **Use Case:** Displaying a single fragment or stacking UI elements, such as an image with text overlay.

In modern Android development, ConstraintLayout is preferred for its flexibility and performance, but these layouts are still used in specific scenarios.

#### c) What are Intents and their importance?

**Answer:**

**What are Intents?**  
Intents are messaging objects in Android used to request an action from another app component, such as starting an activity, launching a service, or delivering a broadcast. They facilitate communication between components within the same app or across different apps.

**Types of Intents:**
1. **Explicit Intents:**
   - Specify the exact component (e.g., a particular activity or service) to be invoked by providing the component’s class name.
   - Example: Starting a specific activity:
     ```java
     Intent intent = new Intent(this, SecondActivity.class);
     startActivity(intent);
     ```

2. **Implicit Intents:**
   - Do not specify a particular component but describe the action to be performed (e.g., open a URL or dial a number). The Android system resolves the intent by findin g a suitable component.
   - Example: Opening a webpage:
     ```java
     Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("https://www.example.com"));
     startActivity(intent);
     ```

**Components of an Intent:**
- **Action:** The operation to perform, e.g., `ACTION_VIEW`, `ACTION_CALL`.
- **Data:** The data to operate on, such as a URI (e.g., a phone number or URL).
- **Category:** Additional information about the kind of component that should handle the intent, e.g., `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`.
- **Extras:** A bundle of additional data passed to the target component.
- **Component Name:** The target component’s class name (for explicit intents).
- **Flags:** Instructions for how the intent should be handled, e.g., `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`.

**Importance of Intents:**
1. **Inter-Component Communication:** Intents enable communication between activities, services, and broadcast receivers within an app.
2. **App Integration:** They allow apps to interact with other apps, such as sharing content, making calls, or opening maps.
3. **Modularity:** Intents promote modular app design by decoupling components, making apps easier to maintain.
4. **User Experience:** They enable seamless navigation and functionality, such as opening a browser or sending an email from within an app.
5. **System Events:** Intents handle system events, such as responding to incoming calls or notifications.

In summary, intents are a core mechanism in Android for facilitating communication, integration, and modularity, enhancing both app functionality and user experience.

### Question 3: Attempt any two questions of the following [2 × 5 = 10]

#### a) What are Option Menu and Context Menu?

**Answer:**

**Option Menu:**
- **Definition:** The Option Menu (or Options Menu) is a primary menu in an Android app, typically displayed as a three-dot (overflow) icon in the app’s action bar or toolbar. It provides access to global app actions, such as settings, search, or refresh.
- **Key Features:**
  - Created by overriding the `onCreateOptionsMenu()` method in an activity.
  - Defined in an XML resource file (e.g., `res/menu/menu_main.xml`) or programmatically.
  - Items can have icons, titles, and actions triggered via `onOptionsItemSelected()`.
  - Example XML:
    ```xml
    <menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
        <item
            android:id="@+id/action_settings"
            android:title="Settings"
            android:icon="@drawable/ic_settings" />
    </menu>
    ```
  - Example Code:
    ```java
    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.menu_main, menu);
        return true;
    }
    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        if (item.getItemId() == R.id.action_settings) {
            // Handle settings click
            return true;
        }
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }
    ```
- **Use Case:** Providing app-wide actions like logging out or accessing help.

**Context Menu:**
- **Definition:** A Context Menu is a floating menu that appears when a user long-presses a view (e.g., a list item or button). It provides actions specific to the selected view.
- **Key Features:**
  - Created by registering a view for a context menu using `registerForContextMenu()` and overriding `onCreateContextMenu()`.
  - Defined in an XML resource or programmatically.
  - Actions are handled in `onContextItemSelected()`.
  - Example Code:
    ```java
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.text_view);
        registerForContextMenu(textView);
    }
    @Override
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {
        super.onCreateContextMenu(menu, v, menuInfo);
        menu.setHeaderTitle("Context Menu");
        menu.add(0, 1, 0, "Copy");
        menu.add(0, 2, 0, "Paste");
    }
    @Override
    public boolean onContextItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        switch (item.getItemId()) {
            case 1:
                // Handle copy
                return true;
            case 2:
                // Handle paste
                return true;
            default:
                return super.onContextItemSelected(item);
        }
    }
    ```
- **Use Case:** Offering item-specific actions, such as copying text or deleting a list item.

**Key Differences:**
- **Scope:** Option Menu is app-wide, while Context Menu is view-specific.
- **Trigger:** Option Menu is accessed via the action bar; Context Menu appears on long-press.
- **Use:** Option Menu for global actions; Context Menu for contextual actions.

Both menus enhance user interaction by providing quick access to relevant actions.

#### b) Explain the following UI components: i) Toast, ii) View Holder

**Answer:**

**i) Toast:**
- **Definition:** A Toast is a small, temporary popup message that provides feedback to the user about an operation. It appears briefly on the screen and disappears automatically without requiring user interaction.
- **Key Features:**
  - Displayed using the `Toast.makeText()` method.
  - Can be customized for duration (`Toast.LENGTH_SHORT` or `Toast.LENGTH_LONG`) and position (using `setGravity()`).
  - Does not block the UI or take focus, making it non-intrusive.
  - Example Code:
    ```java
    Toast.makeText(this, "Login Successful!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    ```
  - Custom Toast Example:
    ```java
    Toast toast = Toast.makeText(this, "Custom Toast", Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
    toast.setGravity(Gravity.TOP | Gravity.CENTER_HORIZONTAL, 0, 100);
    toast.show();
    ```
- **Use Case:** Notifying users of events like “File saved” or “Network error.”
- **Limitations:** Cannot be interacted with, and duration is limited to predefined values.

**ii) View Holder:**
- **Definition:** The View Holder pattern is a design pattern used in Android to improve the performance of list-based UI components, such as ListView or RecyclerView. It caches references to view objects to avoid repeated calls to `findViewById()`, which is resource-intensive.
- **Key Features:**
  - Commonly used in adapters for RecyclerView to bind data to list items efficiently.
  - A ViewHolder class holds references to the views within a list item’s layout (e.g., TextView, ImageView).
  - Improves scrolling performance by reducing view lookup overhead.
  - Example Code (RecyclerView):
    ```java
    public class MyAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder> {
        private List<String> data;

        public MyAdapter(List<String> data) {
            this.data = data;
        }

        @Override
        public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
            View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())
                    .inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false);
            return new ViewHolder(view);
        }

        @Override
        public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {
            holder.textView.setText(data.get(position));
        }

        @Override
        public int getItemCount() {
            return data.size();
        }

        public static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
            TextView textView;

            public ViewHolder(View itemView) {
                super(itemView);
                textView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.text_view);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
- **Use Case:** Displaying lists of items, such as contacts, messages, or products, with smooth scrolling.
- **Advantages:** Enhances performance, reduces memory usage, and improves user experience in list-based UIs.

In summary, Toast provides lightweight feedback, while View Holder optimizes list performance, both critical for responsive Android apps.

#### c) Explain Grid View and Card View.

**Answer:**

**Grid View:**
- **Definition:** GridView is a UI component in Android that displays items in a two-dimensional, scrollable grid layout. It is ideal for presenting data in a tabular format, such as images or icons.
- **Key Features:**
  - Part of the `android.widget` package, extending `AbsListView`.
  - Items are arranged in rows and columns, with customizable column counts (`android:numColumns`).
  - Requires an adapter (e.g., `ArrayAdapter` or `BaseAdapter`) to populate data.
  - Supports item click listeners for user interaction.
  - Example Code:
    ```xml
    <GridView
        android:id="@+id/grid_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:numColumns="3" />
    ```
    ```java
    GridView gridView = findViewById(R.id.grid_view);
    String[] items = {"Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4"};
    ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, items);
    gridView.setAdapter(adapter);
    gridView.setOnItemClickListener((parent, view, position, id) -> {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Clicked: " + items[position], Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    });
    ```
- **Use Case:** Displaying photo galleries, app launchers, or product catalogs.
- **Note:** GridView is older and less flexible than RecyclerView with GridLayoutManager, which is preferred in modern Android development.

**Card View:**
- **Definition:** CardView is a UI component introduced in Android 5.0 (Lollipop) as part of the Material Design library. It displays content in a card-like container with rounded corners, elevation, and shadow effects.
- **Key Features:**
  - Part of the `androidx.cardview.widget` package.
  - Provides a consistent, visually appealing way to group related content (e.g., text, images).
  - Customizable attributes include `cardCornerRadius`, `cardElevation`, and `cardBackgroundColor`.
  - Often used within RecyclerView or other layouts for modular designs.
  - Example XML:
    ```xml
    <androidx.cardview.widget.CardView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:cardCornerRadius="8dp"
        app:cardElevation="4dp"
        app:cardBackgroundColor="#FFFFFF">
        <LinearLayout
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:orientation="vertical"
            android:padding="16dp">
            <TextView
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Card Title" />
            <TextView
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Card Description" />
        </LinearLayout>
    </androidx.cardview.widget.CardView>
    ```
- **Use Case:** Displaying news articles, social media posts, or e-commerce products in a modern, Material Design-compliant UI.
- **Advantages:** Enhances visual hierarchy, supports animations, and aligns with Material Design guidelines.

In summary, GridView is suited for grid-based data presentation, while CardView provides a modern, card-based UI for structured content, often used together in apps for visually appealing layouts.

### Question 4: Attempt any two questions of the following [2 × 5 = 10]

#### a) Explain Popup and Fragments.

**Answer:**

**Popup:**
- **Definition:** A Popup in Android refers to a lightweight, temporary UI element that appears above the current activity to display additional information or options. Common implementations include PopupWindow and PopupMenu.
- **Types:**
  1. **PopupWindow:**
     - A customizable floating window that can contain any view or layout.
     - Displayed at a specific position relative to an anchor view or coordinates.
     - Example Code:
       ```java
       PopupWindow popupWindow = new PopupWindow(this);
       View popupView = LayoutInflater.from(this).inflate(R.layout.popup_layout, null);
       popupWindow.setContentView(popupView);
       popupWindow.setWidth(300);
       popupWindow.setHeight(200);
       popupWindow.showAsDropDown(anchorView, 0, 0);
       ```
     - Use Case: Showing a custom form or tooltip.
  2. **PopupMenu:**
     - A menu that appears anchored to a view, similar to a context menu but triggered by a click.
     - Example Code:
       ```java
       PopupMenu popupMenu = new PopupMenu(this, anchorView);
       popupMenu.getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.popup_menu, popupMenu.getMenu());
       popupMenu.setOnMenuItemClickListener(item -> {
           Toast.makeText(this, "Selected: " + item.getTitle(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
           return true;
       });
       popupMenu.show();
       ```
     - Use Case: Displaying quick actions for a button or icon.
- **Key Features:**
  - Temporary and dismissible by clicking outside or programmatically.
  - Lightweight compared to dialogs, with flexible positioning.
  - Enhances user interaction without navigating to a new screen.
- **Use Case:** Displaying quick options, tooltips, or small forms.

**Fragments:**
- **Definition:** A Fragment is a modular, reusable component of an activity’s UI or behavior. It represents a portion of the user interface or a behavior within an activity and has its own lifecycle.
- **Key Features:**
  - Defined as a subclass of `Fragment` (or its subclasses, e.g., `ListFragment`, `DialogFragment`).
  - Managed by a FragmentManager and hosted within an activity’s layout (e.g., in a FrameLayout).
  - Supports its own layout (defined in XML) and lifecycle methods (e.g., `onCreateView()`, `onStart()`).
  - Can be added, removed, or replaced dynamically without restarting the activity.
  - Example Code:
    ```java
    public class MyFragment extends Fragment {
        @Override
        public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_layout, container, false);
        }
    }
    ```
    ```java
    FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
    FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
    transaction.replace(R.id.fragment_container, new MyFragment());
    transaction.commit();
    ```
- **Advantages:**
  - Enables modular UI design, making it easier to adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., phones vs. tablets).
  - Supports dynamic UI changes, such as swiping between fragments in a ViewPager.
  - Reusable across multiple activities.
- **Use Case:** Implementing tabbed interfaces, master-detail layouts, or reusable UI components like a login form.
- **Lifecycle:** Similar to an activity, with methods like `onCreate()`, `onCreateView()`, `onPause()`, and `onDestroy()`.

In summary, Popups provide temporary, lightweight UI elements for quick interactions, while Fragments enable modular, reusable UI components for flexible app design.

#### b) Explain Threads in Android.

**Answer:**

**Threads in Android:**
Threads in Android are used to perform tasks concurrently, ensuring that long-running operations (e.g., network calls, database operations) do not block the main thread, which is responsible for handling UI updates and user interactions. Running heavy tasks on the main thread can cause the app to become unresponsive, leading to an Application Not Responding (ANR) error.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Main Thread (UI Thread):**
   - The main thread is responsible for handling UI rendering, event handling, and user interactions.
   - All UI updates (e.g., changing TextView text, showing dialogs) must occur on the main thread.
   - Long-running tasks should be offloaded to background threads to keep the UI responsive.

2. **Background Threads:**
   - Background threads handle tasks like network requests, file I/O, or complex computations.
   - They do not have direct access to UI components, requiring mechanisms like `Handler` or `runOnUiThread()` to communicate with the main thread.

**Threading Mechanisms in Android:**
1. **Thread Class:**
   - A basic Java `Thread` can be used to run tasks in the background.
   - Example:
     ```java
     new Thread(() -> {
         // Background task (e.g., fetch data)
         runOnUiThread(() -> {
             // Update UI on main thread
             textView.setText("Data fetched");
         });
     }).start();
     ```
   - Limitation: Manual thread management can be complex.

2. **AsyncTask (Deprecated):**
   - A helper class for running background tasks and updating the UI.
   - Example:
     ```java
     new AsyncTask<Void, Void, String>() {
         @Override
         protected String doInBackground(Void... voids) {
             // Background task
             return "Result";
         }
         @Override
         protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
             // Update UI
             textView.setText(result);
         }
     }.execute();
     ```
   - Replaced by modern alternatives like Kotlin Coroutines or ThreadPoolExecutor.

3. **Handler and Looper:**
   - A `Handler` schedules tasks on a thread’s message queue, often used to communicate between background and main threads.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());
     new Thread(() -> {
         // Background task
         handler.post(() -> textView.setText("Updated"));
     }).start();
     ```

4. **Executors and ThreadPoolExecutor:**
   - Modern approach to manage a pool of threads for background tasks.
   - Example:
     ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
     executor.execute(() -> {
         // Background task
         runOnUiThread(() -> textView.setText("Done"));
     });
     ```

5. **Kotlin Coroutines (Modern):**
   - Simplifies asynchronous programming with suspend functions and scopes (e.g., `viewModelScope`, `lifecycleScope`).
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     lifecycleScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
         // Background task
         val result = fetchData()
         withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
             // Update UI
             textView.text = result
         }
     }
     ```

**Best Practices:**
- Avoid updating UI from background threads; use `runOnUiThread()`, `Handler`, or Coroutines’ `Dispatchers.Main`.
- Use appropriate threading mechanisms based on the task (e.g., Coroutines for modern apps, Executors for Java).
- Handle configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation) to prevent crashes or memory leaks.
- Shut down threads or cancel tasks when the activity is destroyed.

In summary, threads in Android ensure smooth app performance by offloading heavy tasks from the main thread, with modern tools like Coroutines simplifying asynchronous programming.

#### c) Write a short note on Worker Thread.

**Answer:**

**Worker Thread:**  
A worker thread in Android is a background thread used to perform tasks that should not run on the main thread (UI thread) to avoid blocking the user interface. Worker threads handle time-consuming operations, such as network requests, database queries, file operations, or complex calculations, ensuring the app remains responsive.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** Worker threads offload tasks from the main thread to prevent Application Not Responding (ANR) errors, which occur when the UI thread is blocked for too long (typically >5 seconds).
- **Implementation:** Worker threads can be created using:
  - Java’s `Thread` class or `ExecutorService`.
  - Android-specific mechanisms like `AsyncTask` (deprecated), `HandlerThread`, or `WorkManager`.
  - Modern approaches like Kotlin Coroutines or RxJava.
- **Example (Using Thread):**
  ```java
  new Thread(() -> {
      // Perform background task (e.g., download file)
      runOnUiThread(() -> {
          // Update UI after task completion
          textView.setText("Task completed");
      });
  }).start();
